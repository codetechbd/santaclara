            <h1 className='text-2xl text-justify '> <span className='font-black text-2xl'> Santa clara Whisky</span>  – Aged for a minimum 3 years in White French Oak Barrels. Created from a mash bill
                of 50% corn, 40% sugar cane, 50% and 10% rye, this whisky is fantastic for sipping. Santa clara has notes
                of maple and dried fruit on the nose carry over into a palate filled with caramel and a pleasant robust
                oakiness. Finishing off with a slight hint of pepper and baking spices..
